Hey!

I thought I would share a recent project iâ€™ve been working on. Please note that it is not at all complete, however it should give you a decent idea of what I can do. 

The goal of this project is to provide some fine-tuning to a ChatGPT model as well as an interface to curate responses that help users learn concepts, which are broken down from courses and stored in separate chats. Then the model tests users by asking them to repeat concepts back to it, which would return a numeric score, along with gaps in the users knowledge of the concept. Again, as I just started it, it is just a basic layout of components with (some) functionality. It still needs a lot of work.

Thanks!
